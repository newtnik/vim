2. CVSconflict						*CVSconflict-man*

When one uses cvs to update local files, cvs will report that: >
  U 	The file was updated without trouble.
  P 	The file was updated without trouble (you will see this only when
         working with a remote repository).
  M 	The file has been modified by another, but was merged without conflicts.
  C 	The file has been modified by another, but was merged with conflicts.
The CVSconflict plugin works with the last type, conflict files.  Cvs will
insert sections such as >

  <<<<<<<
  ...local version...
  =======
  ...repository version...
  >>>>>>>
<						*CVSconflict* *:CVSconflict*
into your file when it couldn't decide what to do.  With such files, >

  :CVSconflict

will open two vertically split windows and use vim's vimdiff engine to display
two variants of the file (the leftside will be the "local version" and the
right side will be the "repository version").  The two windows' buffers will
be named fileLocal.c and fileRepo.c, given the original name of file.c:
>
  +------------+-----------+
  |fileLocal.c | fileRepo.c|
  +------------+-----------+
<
Neither of these buffers have actually been written; when you're done
modifying them (using |dp|, |do| |]c|, etc), pick one to save.  Please
remember that neither of the two buffers have exactly the same name as the
original file (ie. the one with conflicts) when you do your saving.

							*CVS-W*
After you have used vim's editing command and difference commands (see |do|,
|dp|, and |jumpto-diffs|), you'll likely want to save the file.  One may
choose the current buffer to save to the original filename ("file.c") by
using: >

	:W
<							*CVSwL* *:CVSwR*
Alternatively, one may explicitly choose a window to use to save to the file
with one of the following two commands: >

	:CVSwL       writes buffer fileLocal (fileLocal.c) to file.c
	:CVSwR       writes buffer fileRepo  (fileRepo.c)  to file.c
<
