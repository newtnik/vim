Active & Good: 
  autoload_cscope
  taglist
  CVSConflict (vimdiff on CVS conflict markers)
  DirDiff (recursive vimdiff on dirs)
  fontsize - change font size
  vcs plugin - command line IS good, but this is also useful.

Took out to slim down: 
  MRU - just use Windows taskbar recent items. 
  NrrwRgn (narrow region)
  NERDTree - dito, the builtin explorer and autocomplete under e: was good enough. 
  CtrlP - great but found I could live with built-in functions

Wasted time:
  Solarized - looks crappy on RDP. 
  Unite had a bit better perf but doc was meh. ctrlp now has buffer and mru support AND ctags support. plus it has zero dependencies and does not require C compile
  ConqueTerm  - issues with switching buffers and switch insert/normal mode. sigh. it also really needs to have lcd follow the shell pwd.  
  LargeFile - actually broke large file editing (Agencia STK issue).
